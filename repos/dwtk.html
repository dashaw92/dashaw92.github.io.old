        <h1>DWTK</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
            DWTK is a toolkit that provides a set of widgets (buttons, textboxes, listboxes, and more..) to the developer. With this toolkit,
            the developer no longer needs write all of the widgets from scratch.
            <br />
            DWTK provides an event API for all widgets (with the exception of the built in label) so that advanced applications can be implemented
            in minimal time. 
            <br />
            If the developer needs a custom widget that is not provided by default, a new widget can be created that works like all the others.
            <br />
            DWTK uses <span class="code">java.awt.{Canvas, Graphics}</span> and can be used on top of a current application.
